== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create panoramas for use with PanoPress ? =

First, you must shoot and stitch a panorama, you will need a decent camera capable of manual exposure control, manual focus, and manual white balance setting, a solid tripod and a proper panoramic tripod head like from <a href="http://nodalninja.com">Nodal Ninja</a>, and probably a good fisheye lens although fisheye is not required but it makes things easier -  see the links below for tutorials on how to create a 360 degree panorama and more information on panoramic photography

After shooting your panorama, you will need to stitch it together using a stitching application like <a href="http://www.ptgui.com/">PTGui</a>, <a href="http://www.kolor.com/">AutoPano</a>, or  <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a> and then you must use another application such as <a href="http://www.krpano.com/">KRPano</a>, <a href="http://gardengnomesoftware.com/pano2vr.php">Pano2VR</a>, <a href="http://www.kolor.com/panotour-panotour-pro-comparison.html">Kolor Panotour or Panotour Pro</a>, <a href="http://flashificator.com/">Flash Panorama Player &amp; Flashificator</a>, <a href="http://panozona.com/wiki/SaladoPlayer">Saladoplayer</a> or similar to create interactive 360° VR Panoramas with Flash or HTML5 for web display and use with <a href="http://www.panopress.org/">PanoPress</a>

PanoPress can also be used to embed panos hosted on websites like <a href="http://www.360Cities.net/">360Cities.net</a>, <a href="http://www.viewat.org/">ViewAt.org</a>, <a href="http://www.tourwrist.com/">TourWrist.com</a>, etc

= How do I use PanoPress ? =

1. Install & activate the <a href="http://www.panopress.org/">PanoPress</a> plugin on your WordPress site
2. Upload your Panoramas to your site via FTP
3. Embed your Panoramas in posts & pages using the PanoPress shortcode

= How do I use the PanoPress shortcode ? =

Use the shortcode as below, accepted file types are .swf, .xml, .mov (qtvr) & .html 
.htm, .php, etc as well as php queries like .php?=xx and similar file extensions will also work

Preview images may be .jpg or .png

Width & height are in pixels by default, or can optionally be specified as px, %, em, or other standard CSS units 
Examples: 800px, 100%, 2.5em, etc, you may mix values like width="100%" height="400px"
Note that % width or height will be % of the parent css element, not nessisarily the entire page

File paths in shortcode are either relative to your panorama upload folder as set in panopress settings, or you may use absolute urls

'[pano file="path-from-upload-folder/my-pano/my-pano.swf"]'
'[pano file="my-pano/my-pano.xml" preview="my-pano/my-pano.jpg"]'
'[pano file="my-pano/my-pano.html" preview="my-pano/my-pano.jpg" panobox="on"]'
'[pano file="my-pano/my-pano.html" preview="my-pano/my-pano.jpg" width="100%" height="500px"]'
'[pano file="http://www.EXAMPLE.com/my-pano/my-pano.html"]'

See the <a href="http://www.panopress.org/instructions/">PanoPress Instructions</a> for more shortcode examples & info
